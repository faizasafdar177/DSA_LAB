Travel Planner Using Graph
Description: This project helps travelers plan optimal travel routes between different locations using graph data structures. It considers factors like distance, travel time, and cost to calculate the shortest path between locations.

Learning Outcomes:

Hands-on experience with graph data structures and algorithms.

Understanding different types of graphs and graph traversal techniques.

Implementing shortest path algorithms like Dijkstraâ€™s.

Developing skills in data handling and user interface design.

Key Features:

Represent locations as nodes and travel routes as edges.

Assign weights to edges based on distance, travel time, or cost.

Implement graph traversal and shortest path algorithms.

Provide a user interface for entering source, destination, and preferences.

Real-World Application:

Navigation systems for optimal road finding.

Logistics and supply chain industry for efficient delivery routes.

Travel agencies for planning efficient travel routes for clients.
